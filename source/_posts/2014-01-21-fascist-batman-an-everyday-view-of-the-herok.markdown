It's amazing how scary and reprehensible Batman would seem without the context the viewer / reader has in the comics. Especially in the modern times, he is a rich vigilante with a one man war. Anytime one person has that kind of power and chooses to purse it in ways outside the law it is SCARY, no matter who his victims / targets are.
